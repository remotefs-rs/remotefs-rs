## About remotefs ‚òÅÔ∏è

remotefs is a library that provides a file system structure to work with all the most popular file transfer protocols.
This is achieved through a trait called `RemoteFs` which exposes methods to operate on the remote file system.
Currently the library exposes a client for **Sftp**, **Scp**, **Ftp** and **Aws-s3** as external libraries.

### Why remotefs ‚ùì

You might be wondering, "why remotefs?"
The first and foremost reason is to provide a generic interface over multiple protocols.
For example, in [termscp](https://github.com/veeso/termscp) it allows the support of multiple protocols without any protocol-specific code.
The second reason is that often, users just want a simple way to operate on a remote file system, however, they don't have the time to spend researching the ins and outs of each protocol.

Using remotefs, this is no longer a problem: all you need is to configure the options to your liking, then you're ready to connect.

---

## Features üéÅ

- üìÅ Different communication protocols
  - **Aws S3**
  - **FTP** and **FTPS**
  - **SFTP**
  - **SCP**
  - **SMB**
- ‚úîÔ∏è Configurable: use only the client that you need
- ü§ñ Extensible: adding new protocols is easy
- üöÄ Simple: easy to setup
- üòÑ Understandable: no need to understand the underlying protocol

---

## Get started üöÄ

First, add `remotefs` to your list of dependencies:

```toml
remotefs = "^0.2.0"
```

select over a variety of features:

- `find`: enable the `find()` method on `RemoteFs` trait (_enabled by default_)
- `no-log`: disable logging. By default, the `log` crate is used.

### Client libraries üîå

To use an existing client, you must add them to your `Cargo.toml`, along with remotefs:

- [aws-s3](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-aws-s3)

  ```toml
  remotefs-aws-s3 = "^0.2.0"
  ```

- [ftp](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-ftp)

  ```toml
  remotefs-ftp = { version = "^0.1.0", features = [ "secure" ] }
  ```

- [smb](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-smb)

  ```toml
  remotefs-smb = "^0.2.0"
  ```

- [ssh](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-ssh)

  ```toml
  remotefs-ssh = "^0.2.0"
  ```

- [webdav](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-webdav)

  ```toml
  remotefs-webdav = "^0.1.0"
  ```

## Remote file system üíæ

As mentioned earlier, this library exposes a trait called `RemoteFs`.
This trait exposes several methods to operate on a remote file system via the chosen client.

Let's briefly go over which methods are available:

- **connect**: connect to the remote host.
- **disconnect**: disconnect from the remote host.
- **is_connected**: returns whether the client is connected to the remote host.
- **append_file**: append specified buffer to the specified file.
- **append**: open a file for append and returns a stream to write to it.
- **change_dir**: change the working directory to provided path.
- **copy**: copy a file from the specified source path to the specified destination.
- **create_dir**: create a directory with the specified file mode at the specified path.
- **create_file**: create a file at a specified path with the specified content.
- **create**: create a file and returns a stream to write to it.
- **exec**: executes a shell command.
- **exists**: checks whether file at specified path exists.
- **list_dir**: get entries at the provided path.
- **mov**: move a file from the specified source path to the specified destination.
- **open_file**: open a file for reading and fill the specified buffer with the file content.
- **open**: open a file and returns a stream to read it.
- **pwd**: get working directory.
- **remove_dir_all**: remove file/directory and all of its content.
- **remove_dir**: remove directory at the specified path. It fails if it is not an empty directory.
- **remove_file**: remove file at the specified path. It fails if it is not a file.
- **setstat**: set file metadata for file at the specified path.
- **stat**: get file information of file at the specified path.
- **symlink**: create a symlink at the specified path, pointing to the specified file.

### Client compatibility table ‚úîÔ∏è

The following table states the compatibility for each client associated with the remote file system trait method.

Note: `connect()`, `disconnect()` and `is_connected()` **MUST** always be supported, and are so omitted in the table.
