## 0.2.0

Released on ??

- Moved protocols to **extern crates**:
  - [aws-s3](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-aws-s3)
  - [ftp](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-ftp)
  - [ssh](https://github.com/veeso/remotefs-rs-ssh)
- Merged `File`, `Directory` and `Entry` into a unique struct called `File`. File types (symlink, file, directory) are now differentiated by the `file_type` attribute in `Metadata`.
- `find` method is now optional, via the `find` feature (enabled by default)
- Implemented `From` trait for `Metadata`.
- `create` and `append` will now return a `WriteStream` instead of a box, which will contain the inner stream which supports `Write` and may support `Seek` (according to the protocol).
- `read` will now return a `ReadStream` instead of a box, which will contain the inner stream which supports `Read` and may support `Seek` (according to the protocol).
